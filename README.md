## Introduction
As the population level is increasing day by day food production plays a major role in it. The quality of the food products is essential for good healthy human beings. For providing this healthy environment analysis of various factor that causes a productive loss in agriculture has to be done. Identification of diseased part, Image classification, Detection of an anomaly in plant leaves open wide area research named image processing in agriculture. Maintain proper irrigation in the field helps in increasing the crop yield. Machine learning technique helps in improving the crop yield by maintaining the water level in the root region, average vegetable yield ratio is an increase, and plant need is measured using soil moisture sensor.Scope and responsibilities of plant disease detection is unlimited. Its ultimate goal is to prevent and control plant diseases of economic importance. Responsibilities of the science of plant pathology may be summarized as under. In plants most of the leaf diseases are caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. The diseases caused due to these organisms are characterized by different visual symptoms that could be observed in the leaves or stem of a plant. Usually, these symptoms are detected manually. With the help of image processing, Automatic detection of various diseases can be detected with the help of image processing. Image processing plays a crucial role in the detection of plant diseases since it provides best results and reduces the human efforts. 


## Accuracy
To build up this framework we have developed a compact device and an APP which comprises of the proposed system in a composed way. Device is proposed to be as concise as possible intending to occupy less space. Extraordinarily structured circuit has been organized so it will be outstandingly small in size. The app will be an all in one app to help farmers implement smart farming.
Our model achieves an training accuracy of 90.19 % and validation accuracy of 91.97%. Above is the plot of tarining and validiation accuracy.
